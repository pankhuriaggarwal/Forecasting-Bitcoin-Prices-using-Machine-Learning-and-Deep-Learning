Forecasting daily values of the Bitcoin using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models

Methodology:
- Deep Learning Models used are Multi-layer Perceptron, Gated Recurrent Unit + Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network and Long Short-term Memory Model
- Machine Learning Models used are Support Vector Regressor and Random Forest Regressor
- Traditional Models used are Autoregressive Integrated Moving Averages and Naive Forecasting
- All these models are compared for predicition accuracy using the Root Mean Squared Error. 

Data:
The dataset consists of time series data of one output and 30 input variables collected daily from Sep 17, 2014 to Aug 17, 2020.
